## Project Overview

This project is part of the Masterschool Data programme focusing on data visualization and analysis using Tableau. Through multiple phases, it explores real-world player data from FIFA 23, applying best practices in dashboard design and analytical storytelling. The project aims to develop hands-on experience with data visualization that answer key performance questions, refine visualization techniques, and uncover insights into team composition, scouting, and player valuation.

The Tableau Public Dashboard can be [viewed online](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/annelize.krause/viz/FIFA23PlayerAnalysis/db-player-trends) and the workbook can be downloaded [here](/fifa-23-dashboard-part-1.twb).

## Part 1: Initial Dashboard and Objectives

In the first part of this project, the foundation is built with essential analytical questions and core dashboard elements. It uses interactive visualizations to answer key analytical questions such as:

1. **Bar chart:** Identify the top 10 clubs with highest average player ratings
2. **Scatter plot:** Analyze how a player's potential compares to their current overall rating for each country
3. **Line chart:** Determine how player key attributes (`Dribbling`, `Finishing`, `Long Shots`, `Short Passing`, `Strength` and `Stamina`) contribute to the overall rating
4. **Tree map:** Which clubs have the highest total player market value?
5. **Scatter plot:** Compare players' wages against their overall rating
6. **Bubble chart:** Explore how the top 20 player market value changes with potential rating
7. **Bar chart:** Identify FIFA 23â€™s most expensive players based on market value

The key objective is to deliver an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore key player trends using filters to drill down at country level. The goal is to understand how players from different countries fare in rating and wage, assess their growth potential, and analyze their contribution to club ratings.
